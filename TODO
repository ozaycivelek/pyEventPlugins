Ideas :
=======================
1. Can we add a plugin type in order to support XMLRPC calls as event handlers?
	- Add another layer between plugins and PluginMount
	- Act based on type??
	- Or just form a wrapper around Events such as RPCEvents?
2. Can we return values somehow? Do we have to?
3. Do we need a shared scope between program logic and plugins?
4. We keep calling the event handlers sequentially with no respect to changes in the data set
   delivered to the handler. Maybe this would also answer idea 3
5. Can we dynamically update the plugin directory just in case we wish to use the system for
   demonized processes?
6. Would it be beneficial to add socket support?
